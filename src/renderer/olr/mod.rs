//! OLR sub-renderer for object to loudspeaker rendering.

//! This module provides the core implementation of the OLR, which renders
//! object-based audio elements to target loudspeaker layouts. It coordinates
//! speaker layouts, gain calculations, metadata interpretation, and block-based
//! audio processing using VBAP and DBAP.
