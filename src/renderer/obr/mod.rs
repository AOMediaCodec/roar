//! Open Binaural RoarRenderer (OBR) sub-renderer module.
//!
//! This subsystem implements the OBR, which processes channel-based, scene-based (Ambisonic),
//! and object-based audio inputs to produce binaural headphone output.
//! It supports head tracking to dynamically rotate the audio scene based on the listener's
//! orientation.
//!
//! All DSP processing in this subsystem must be allocation-free and suitable for execution on
//! realtime threads.
