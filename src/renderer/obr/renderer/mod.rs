//! High-level OBR orchestrator and processing groups.
//!
//! This module contains the main entry points and high-level orchestrations for the OBR subsystem,
//! including the top-level `ObrImpl` struct and `ProcessingGroup` for grouping audio elements that
//! share binaural filter profiles and Ambisonic orders.
//!
//! These components coordinate the rendering lifecycle, mapping inputs (loudspeaker channels,
//! object channels, or Ambisonic scenes) to the appropriate internal representations and invoking
//! the DSP components.
